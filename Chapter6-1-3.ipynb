Up until that visit, IoT had been largely theoretical to me. Of course, I know the usual mumbo-jumbo about wearables and IoT-connected fitness trackers. That stuff is all well and good, but it�s somewhat old hat � plus I am not sure we are really benefiting so much from those, so I�m not that impressed.\n",
